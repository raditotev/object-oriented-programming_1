      <div class="section-description">
        <p>
          HTML documents are the heart of the web. HTML stands for <b>HyperText</b> markup language. HTML is made up of text content (what you see), markup(what that content looks like or how it's arranged), references to other documents (images, videos etc.) and links to other pages.

      <div class="section-title">Tags</div>
      <div class="section-description">
        <p>
          HTML markup is made up of things called <b>opening and closing tags</b>. The whole thing might be referred as an <b>element</b>. There are two types of elements: <b>inline</b> and <b>block</b> elements. Inline element is in line with the text (e.g. span), whereas block element forms an imaginary block around the content (e.g. div). There are also <b>void</b> elements such as: br, img and link.          
        </p>

      <div class="section-description">
        <p>
          There is a special type of tags with <b>attributes</b>. These are tags withholding attributes inside. Examples of tags with attributes are img, a, link etc. Creating links to other content is done using the src (for images) or href attributes.

          The basic structure of an HTML document consist a head element containing title element and body, all wrapped in html element. As the HTML page grows there will be more elements within element or so called <b>tree like structure</b>.

      <div class="section-description">
        <p>
          Building a web page can be compared with the building of a house. We first start building the foundations, the walls and we finish the basic structure with the roof. This is just like the HTML. After we finish with the basic structure we start work on the external and internal decoration of the house. Painting the walls, furnishing the place and hanging paintings. This is the role of CSS in our document. With CSS we can set different appearance for every single element in our HTML document. Finally we equip our house with some gadgets. Some might might be as simple as automatic garage door some might be as complex as home automation system. This is the place for Javascript in our web page.

        <p>
          <b>HTML</b> is the language of the web. It has syntax and its rules. The basic word in HTML is tag. The browser turns HTML tags into elements that form a tree. It knows how to do that because of the DOM.          
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>CSS</b> - Cascading Style Sheets - style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>DOM</b> - Document Object Model - a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages). The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.

      <div class="section-description">
        <p>
          Everything on a web page is a box. By thinking in terms of boxes front end developers can easily rearrange things if they decide to give the users different experience. There is also a grid in the background that serves to make sure that everything is properly aligned.          
        </p>
        <p>
          Boxes are made up of several components. The first one is the core of the box and this is the content. It might be text or image or video or something else. Than we have padding, surrounded by the border and the outer component is called margin.

      <div class="section-description">
        <p>
          Adding style to a html document can be done in different ways. We can link our HTML document to a CSS document using the link tag in the head element. We can also add style tag within the HTML document in the head element and set the appearance for the different elements or we can use styling attributes within the individual elements.

          <div class="section-description">
            <p>Programming is the process of giving computers certain instructions using a programming language. There are many different programming languages, but the language we're using in our study is called Python.</p>

          <div class="section-description">
            <p>We use programming languages because of their unambiguity. In natural languages one thing may mean different things where as in programming languages every command is unambiguous meaning there is only one interpretation.</p>

          <div class="section-description">
            <p>Just like the grammar rules in natural languages there are rules in every programming language called syntax that have to be followed. Expression is something that has a value. We can also make an expression by combining other expressions with a set of operators (e.g. +, -, *, /).</p>

          <div class="section-title">Variables</div>
          <div class="section-description">
            <p>Variable is a name created by us that refers to a value. The way to introduce a variable is by using an assignment statement (e.g. name = expression). A name could be any combination of characters as long as it starts with a letter and is not one of the Python keywords. Variables can change their value.</p>                
          </div>
      </div>
      <div class="section" id="section-6-3">    
          <div class="section-title">Strings</div>
          <div class="section-description">
            <p>String is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes. Quotes can be single, double or in case of multiple lines triple. Valid strings start and end with the same quotes. We can join (concatenate) strings using + operator but we can't combine strings with numbers.</p>    
            <p>Another thing we can do with strings is to extract sub sequences or single characters. We can extract character using square brackets and an expression (e.g. <span class="highlight">[expression]</span>). To select a sub sequence we need to set a start and end position separated by a colon inside the square brackets (e.g.<span class="highlight">[expression : expression]</span>). All expressions must be numbers.
            </p>
            <p>There are different operations or methods that can be applied on strings. This is one of them:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>find</b>
                <ul class="bullets">
                  <li>Using one parameter<br>
                    <b>Use:</b> string1.<b>find</b>(string2)<br>
                    <b>Explanation:</b> finds where string2 occurs in string1.<br>
                    <b>Return value:</b> position of the first occurrence – a number. If none -1.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <ul class="bullets">
                  <li>Using two parameters<br>
                    <b>Use:</b> string1.<b>find</b>(string2, number)<br>
                    <b>Explanation:</b> finds where string2 occurs in string1 after the first occurrence if number is greater that the return value of the first position.<br>
                    <b>Return value:</b> position of the second occurrence – a number. If none -1.
                  </li>

          <div class="section-title">Procedures/ Functions</div>
          <div class="section-description">
            <p>Function is a callable sub-program within a larger program. To create a function we need to give it a name followed by opening parentheses, list of inputs and closing parentheses followed by a colon(e.g. <span class="highlight">function(input1, input2):</span> ). Inputs are called operands or arguments. The line after the name and the input of the function is the body. Inside the body is the place where we write/ give all instructions for this function to perform usually ending with a return statement. The return statement is the function’s output. To summarise, this is how a function work:</p>
            <p class="center_yellow">INPUT >>> FUNCTION (SOME CALCULATIONS/ OPERATIONS) >>> OUTPUT</p>
            <p>One of the main rules in programming is to avoid repetition. Functionas are extremely helpful in this regard. If we have a set of operations that we need to perform often, we can build a function and call it every time we have to apply those operations. We can also use functions within functions, meaning we can break a complicated and long set of operations into a number of different simpler functions. And last but not least, in every programming language there is an extensive list of built in functions we can use whenever needed(e.g. <span class="highlight">append(), index(), len()</span>).</p>

          <div class="section-description">
            <p>To make code behave differently we need to make decision based on what the data is. To make those decisions we need some comparisons. Python provides different operators for comparison.</p>
            <p>This is a list with some of them:</p>                
            <ul class="bullets">

              <li>== equal</li>
              <li>!= not equal</li>

          <div class="section-description">
            <p>Having the knowledge to make decisions, we now need something to make code behave different. The way to do that is by using if statement. The syntax of if statement is:</p>
            <p> if &lt;test expression&gt;:</p>
            <p class="indented">&lt;first block of code&gt;</p>

            <p>while &lt;test expression&gt;:</p>
            <p class="indented">&lt;block of code&gt;</p>
            <p>Until the test expression is true, the block of code inside the loop will be executed over and over again. There is a way of stopping the loop before the test expression is false and it is done by using the break statement. This could be very handy if we have another condition inside the loop and it’s fulfilled before the test expression changes its value.</p>

            <p>Important steps in debugging a problem:</p>

          <div class="section-title">Structured data: Lists</div>
          <div class="section-description">
            <p>String is a type of structured data but its use is limited to characters only. To store different kinds of data we need another structured data type called list. Lists can store sequences of anything. Just like in string we can access different elements of a list using the same syntax: <span class="highlight">random_list[0]</span> gives us access to the first element of <span class="highlight">random_list</span>. We can slice sub sequences: <span class="highlight">random_list[0 : 3]</span>, this will give us all elements between index 0 and 3 (<span class="highlight">not incl.</span>). As mentioned before lists can store all kind of data including other lists. A list within a list is called nested list.</p>            
            <p>There is another big difference between strings and lists and that’s the list’s ability to support mutation. Mutation means we can change the value of a list after it’s been created.</p>
            <p>List operations:</p>
            <ul class="bullets">
              <li><b>append()</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Use:</b> list.<b>append</b>(element)<br>
                    <b>Explanation:</b> append adds a new element at the end of the list. This method is mutator.<br>                    
                  </li>
                </ul>

                  <li>
                    <b>Use:</b> [0, 1] + [2, 3]<br>
                    <b>Explanation:</b> Joins two lists together: [0, 1, 2, 3].

                  <li>
                    <b>Use:</b> <b>len</b>(list)<br>
                    <b>Explanation:</b> gives us the number of elements in the list. In case of nested lists, len only counts the number of the outer elements.<br>

                  <li>
                    <b>Use:</b> list.<b>index</b>(value)<br>
                    <b>Explanation:</b> index looks for value inside the list and returns the value position, where it first occurs. If the value we are looking for isn’t in the list, index returns error.<br>

                <p>
                  As the name suggest <span class="highlight">O</span>bject <span class="highlight">O</span>riented <span class="highlight">P</span>rogramming is a type of language based on the concept of <span class="highlight">objects</span>. This type of programming defines not only the data type of a structure, but also the types of operations (<span class="highlight">methods</span>) that can be applied to the data structure. These data structures are called objects and they contain data in the form of fields, aka <span class="highlight">attributes</span>.
                </p>  
                <p>
                  OOP is a very powerful tool when it comes to large scale projects. Here are some of the advantages:
                  <ul class="bullets">
                    <li>
                      Modules created in a OO program can easily be reused in other programs. Once a module is created, knowledge of how it actually works isn't neccessary for its use. In procedure-based programming, coders needed understand the details of a piece of code before using it. Objects in object-based program development can be extended to include new attributes and behaviors and they can be reused within and accross applications. Beacause of this OOP proves to be more reliable software development tool, suitable for large scale projects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      It's easy to maintain and modify existing code. Because of its modular nature, updates can be applied to individual modules without the need of large-scale changes. If there are issues, it's easier to locate the problem since we apply the changes gradually.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Reuse of code helps for faster development. The extensive list of libraries in and outside the standart library helps us build our application and saves time. The code we write could be reused in other projects to come, thus saving us time and money.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      All of the above helps programmers spend less time writing code and allows them to analize and verify the software, resulting in higher quality and fault proof applications.

                <p>
                  Class is code in a file in or outside <span class="highlight">Python Standart Library</span>. In that class we have function called <span class="highlight">__init__</span> (short for initialize). Every time we call a class we run this method by default and it creates space in memory for a new object. The newly created object can access the rest of the methods inside the class. Every class has a set of <span class="highlight">attributes</span> (properties) that apply to multiple objects created of that class. We can think of a class as a blue print and we can think of its objects as examples of objects of that blue print.

                  The <span class="highlight">from... import</span> statement in Python lets us <span class="highlight">import specific attributes from a module into the current namespace</span>. In our example we have from twilio.rest import TwilioRestClient When we look in twilio github page we can find a directory called twilio. Inside is another directory called 'rest'. In rest, there is a   python file where we can find class called TwilioRestClient. Basically what the from...import statement does is, finding class TwilioRestClient in /twilio/rest/__init__.py and implementing this code in our file. We can also import directories but in this case when we create object we have to write the name of the directory in front of the class name followed by a dot.

                <p>
                  First thing when creating a class is to write the keyword <span class="highlight">class</span> and a <span class="highlight">Name</span>. It's recommended the name we give to have logical connection with the class and to start with a capital letter. A class can have both data and methods(functions inside a class). As mentioned prior a class can have multiple objects or instances. When we create an object of a class, the class's <span class="highlight">constructor</span> is called. This is the <span class="highlight">__init__</span> method inside the class. This is where we <span class="highlight">initialize</span> all the data associated with the object/ instance. The constructor uses the keyword <span class="highlight">self</span>. <span class="highlight">Self</span> refers to the object/ instance. All variables associated with a specific instance/ object are called <span class="highlight">instance variables</span>. Those are unique to an object and can be accessed using the 'self' keyword inside a class and the instance name outside the class. All functions inside a class associated with an object/ instance and have self as an argument are called <span class="highlight">instance methods</span>.

                  <span class="highlight">Class variables</span> are defined in the class, outside class's methods. Class variables can be accessed by every instance (object) of that class. If a <span class="highlight">class variable</span> is not expected to change it's value (i.e. <span class="highlight">constant</span>), Python conventions recommend use of capital letters for the name, e.g. <span class="highlight">CLASS_VARIABLE</span>.

            <div class="section-title">Inheritance</div>
            <div class="section-description">
                <p>
                  When we have a class with a number of atributes and another class with the same attributes plus some more, instead of rewriting everything again for the new class we can use what we already have and just add the new attributes. We can do this by declaring our new class as a child of the first one. Our child class can now access all the attributes declared in its parent class(the first class).<br>
                  Example:
                </p>
                <img src="http://i.imgur.com/T2cOfEY.png?1" alt="Parent-Child Class"> 
                 <p>
                  This relationship between classes is called <span class="highlight">Inheritance</span>. Another feature of inheritance is <span class="highlight">method reuse</span>. This means we can <span class="highlight">access</span> and <span class="highlight">use methods</span> in our Parent class with an object of a Child class.
                 </p> 
                 <p>
                  When a method defined in the child class <span class="highlight">overrides</span> a method with the same name in the parent class, it's called <span class="highlight">method overriding</span>.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  A good example for inheritance can be made with what we've already learned about styling HTML pages. For example, if we set certain properties for the body element like font-style, color or family, all these properties will be inherited by the child elements: paragraphs, lists etc. But if we set different properties for one of the elements, this element will appear different than the rest inside the body. The reason for this is just like in method overriding in classes, we override the inherited values with the local inside the element.
